Plantastic is a plant care website where users can search for plants they're interested in and see how to take care of them. On the Plants page, users can filter plants based on a plant's needs, like more or less sunlight required. The filtering is set up to include plants with any of the selected tags, not just plants with all of the selected tags. There is also a search function that returns all of the instances of the search keyword on the website. The contact does not go anywhere, but the phone number is a little Easter egg that spells out GET-GREN. All of the plant information and images were sourced from https://bloomscape.com.
